# IT Bachelor Program
The IT Bachelor program in [IIT](https://www.iit.tn) consists of 6 Semester, the last of which is an internship for an End of Studies Project at a Company. 

Unfortunately I only started taking digitized notes from the 3rd semester Onwards, they still need to be processed before they get uploaded to the website.
