# About this Website
This website is an effort to share lecture notes, summaries and other artefacts from whatever I'm studying at the moment. 

[[Publish/Who am I ?|Who am I ?]]

This website was made using [Obsidian.md](https://www.obsidian.md), an awsome note taking app, as well as using The [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) plugin made by [Ole Eskild Steensen](https://ole.dev/).
